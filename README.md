## Overview

**Mida** is a versatile plain text music notation language that allows musicians and developers to write, transcribe, and manipulate music in a streamlined and intuitive manner. Designed with deep learning and AI integration in mind, Mida supports a wide range of musical elements, including notes, chords, lyrics, percussion, and multitracks. Its flexible hierarchy and advanced features make it suitable for both simple compositions and complex, AI-driven music projects.

## Features

### Basic Notation

Mida uses simple symbols to represent musical elements, making it easy to read and write.

- **Notes**: Represented by their name and octave, e.g., `A4`, `Bb2`.
- **Rests and Sustains**:
  - `.`: 16th rest
  - `-`: 16th note sustain
- **Durations**: Extend note lengths using hyphens or the tilde (`~`) for conciseness.
  - `A#4---`: Quarter note A#4
  - `*A#4~3-*`: Quarter note A#4 using shorthand

**Example:**
```mida
Audicle: *A---B---C---D---E---F...G...*
```

### Chords

Chords are written by listing each individual note, allowing for flexibility without the need for chord names.

- **Single Chord**:
  ```mida
  Audicle: *C3~E3~G3~16-*
  ```
  Plays a C major chord on the third octave for 16 sixteenth notes.

- **Guitar Chords**:
  ```mida
  Audicle: *G;022000~16-*
  ```
  Represents an Em chord using guitar tab notation in standard tuning.

### Lyrics

Lyrics can be paired with melody lines or defined separately, allowing for synchronized or independent lyric placement.

- **Basic Lyrics**:
  ```mida
  Audicle: *Three---goes-to--one-which---goes-to--four----*
  ```

- **Lyrics with Notes**:
  ```mida
  Audicle: *Three~C4---Goes~E4---To~G4---*
  ```

### Percussion

Mida supports 47 percussion instruments, mapped to standard MIDI percussion notes with intuitive abbreviations.

**Percussion Table:**

| MIDI Note | Instrument         | Abbreviation |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------|
| 35        | Acoustic Bass Drum | ABD          |
| 36        | Bass Drum 1        | BD1          |
| 37        | Side Stick/Rimshot | SSR          |
| ...       | ...                | ...          |
| 81        | Open Triangle      | OTR          |

**Example Drum Beat:**
```mida
Audicle: *ABD . CHH . SSR . BD1~CHH . | CHH . BD1~SSR . CHH . CHH*
```

### Multitracks

Organize multiple tracks such as Drums, Bass, Vocals, and Others within a Program for complex compositions.

**Example Multitrack Setup:**
```mida
Audicle: *Program; Drums, Bass, Vocals, Others*
Drums; *CHH~7-CHH~7-CHH~7-CHH~7-*
Bass; *C1~31.*
Vocals; *Hello~C4~31.*
Others; *E3~G3~31-*

// Another section using Program
Audicle: *Program; Drums, Bass, Vocals, Others*
Drums; *BD1~7-SSR~7-CHH~7-CHH~7-*
Bass; *C1~31-B1~31-*
Vocals; *Goodbye~D4~31.*
Others; *E3~A3~31-*
```

### Advanced Features

#### Recording, Trimming, and Editing Clips

Mida allows users to record, trim, and edit clips directly through text commands, offering a fully featured recording experience similar to a traditional DAW. Each recording is treated as an environmental variable that can be interacted with in real time.

**Example of Recording and Braiding:**
```mida
Audicle: *Block*~*Braid*
Permissions; *Record*
Arm; *#123456* // Example channel address to arm, also arming a braid to print a debug statement
*C4*
*Braid*

// Output:
// mida stream:
// C4
// C4
```
- **Explanation**: In this example, the braid is recording itself and anything that passes through it. The braid is essentially copying the musical data captured during the recording process.
- If the recording step is omitted, the braid behaves differently:
  ```mida
  Audicle: *C4*~*Braid*
  *Braid*

  // Output:
  // mida stream:
  // C4~Braid
  // C4 // (Braided)
  ```
  Without explicit recording, the braid still copies the note but does not capture it in the same way as during the recording process.
- **Environmental Recording**: Recording is treated as an environmental stateâ€”once armed, any data that passes through is captured, providing flexibility similar to a looping station or overdub setup in a DAW.

This unique approach allows for a conceptual separation between capturing the "potential" for audio and ensuring the actual recorded data is interactable and can be played or manipulated further.

#### Effect Chains and Routing

Mida allows users to create and chain multiple effects, similar to plugin chains in traditional DAWs. You can apply EQ, compression, reverb, and more to any track, giving full flexibility in sound shaping.

**Example of Using EQ and Compression Together:**
```mida
Audicle: *EQ~Comp*
*C#3- - -*
EQ; *Default* // *Bands:{Low,Mid,High} Low; Type: Lowpass; Q: 0.5; Hz: 100; Bypassed: False; Gain: 1db; Mid; Type: Bandpass; Q: 0.5; Hz: 1000; Bypassed: False; Gain: 1db; High; Type: Highpass; Q: 0.5; Hz: 10,000, Bypassed: False; Gain: 1db*
Comp; *Default* // *Ratio:4x~Thresh:Unity~Atk:0.10ms~Rel:0.10*
*C#3- - -*
```
- **Explanation**: This example plays a note (`C#3`), sets up an EQ and compressor, and then plays the note again. The second time the note is played, it has the effects applied. The EQ is configured with multiple bands (Low, Mid, High), and the compression is set with default parameters.
- **Automatable**: Each parameter of the EQ or compressor can be automated, making it possible to shape the sound dynamically over time.

### Molly and Trimming Clips

**Molly** is a versatile helper in Mida used to facilitate non-audio actions like trimming files or acting as an agent at the Audicle level. Molly can automate otherwise cumbersome operations, such as automatically restoring a state or handling specific non-musical tasks.

**Example of Trimming with Molly**:
```mida
Audicle *Molly*
Molly; *Trim*~r*Ribbon!!##1#123456@abcdef*
*Trim; Start:1s; End:6s*
Molly; *Restore*
```
In this example, Molly is used to manage trimming on a specific audio file, identified by its ribbon, channel, and file address. Molly helps manage actions like trimming without affecting the actual sound, simplifying the process.

If you need to trim without using Molly, you can still achieve it manually:
```mida
Audicle *Trim*~r*Ribbon!!##1#123456@abcdef*
*Trim; Start:1s; End:6s*
Label; *Undo*
```
Molly's usefulness is more apparent when more advanced automation is involved.

**Automating Trimming**:
```mida
Audicle *Molly~Label*
Molly; *Trim*~r*Ribbon!!##1#123456@abcdef*
*Trim; Start:1s; End:6s*
*Hello~World!*
Molly; *Restore*
```
- **Explanation**: In this example, Molly automates the trimming process, trims an audio file, and then restores it after playback. The `Label` helps manage the trim duration, and `Restore` brings the Audicle back to its initial state.

Another manual example:
```mida
Audicle *Trim~Label*~r*Ribbon!!##1#123456@abcdef*
*Trim; Start:1s; End:6s*
*Hello~World!*
Label; *Undo-Undo*
```
- **Explanation**: This manually trims the file and, through `Undo`, reverts the clip to its original state after playback.

This is particularly useful for trimming actions that need to be reversible, just like a DAW's non-destructive editing capabilities.

## Hierarchy

### Programs

Programs are sequences that play one after another within a Ribbon. Each Program contains multiple tracks.

### Matrixes

Matrixes act as the mastering stage, managing sub-mixes before sending to the Program feed.

### Busses

Busses handle flexible routing and allow for automation of parameters. They can route signals to multiple destinations without taking exclusive control.

### Groups and DCAs

- **Groups**: Organize multiple tracks without having a fader, useful for structural organization.
- **DCAs (Digitally Controlled Amplifiers)**: Control gain across multiple tracks with a fader, without processing the signal.

### Braids, Trusses, and Ribbons

- **Braids**: Copy and modify audio data for reuse across sections.
- **Trusses**: Manage four-channel systems for parallel playback.
- **Ribbons**: Represent entire projects or sessions, containing multiple Programs.

## AI Integration

- **Usage**:
  ```mida
  Audicle: *Tree*
  Tree; *Generate new music based on C4-G4 melody*
